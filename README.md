# Chad Spilker Portfolio

## Description

This project was created for me to showcase my work as a budding developer. I have started with my basic HTML/CSS skills and will continue to refine this portfolio page as I learn more. This will be helpful to show to potential employers when I begin my job hunt. This was my first page built from scratch and I learned how rewarding and frustrating that process can be. Overall, I really had fun!
