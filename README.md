# Chad Spilker Portfolio

## Description

This project was created for me to showcase my work as a budding developer. I have started with my basic HTML/CSS skills and will continue to refine this portfolio page as I learn more. This will be helpful to show to potential employers when I begin my job hunt. This was my first page built from scratch and I learned how rewarding and frustrating that process can be. Overall, I really had fun!


## Usage


Active URL:

Screenshot:

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
